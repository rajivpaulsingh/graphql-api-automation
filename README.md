# GraphQL API Automation Framework

We are using the following elements in this API automation framework:
 - Rest Assured library
 - TestNG testing framework
 - log4j2 
 - Apache Maven
 - Selenium Java
 - pom.xml
 
 ## Rest Assured
 API automation framework in this repository. Rest Assured is one of the most popular libraries which is highly used in API Test Automation using Java.
 
 ## TestNG
 TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language. The design goal of TestNG is to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc. The major advantages of TestNG are:
 - Provides the ability to produce HTML reports
 - Annotations made easy
 - Test cases can be grouped and prioritized
 - Parallel testing is possible
 - Data parametrization is possible
 
 Use testng.xml to run all the tests or group the tests based on the priority, classifications, smokes or regression.

 
 ## log4j2
 Apache log4j is a Java based logging utility. It allows us to define our own log levels.
 
 ## Apache Maven
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. Use pom.xml to install the required dependencies. 
  
 ## Selenium Java
 Selenium is an open source testing tool that caters different type of testing. Its a portable framework for testing web application, mobile apps and APIs.
